# Netflix-Project
I conducted an analysis of Netflix's shows and movies data using powerful Python libraries such as Numpy and Pandas. To create visually stunning charts and graphs, I expertly utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn. Drawing valuable insights from the data, I made recommendations that will surely make an impact.

With precision and expertise, I tackled the challenge of addressing the numerous NaN values in the data. To enable a more comprehensive analysis, I segregated the data into two categories - TV shows and movies. My presentation of the data insights was made even more effective by including captivating graphs that highlighted the key takeaways.
