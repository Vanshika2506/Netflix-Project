# Netflix-Project
In this Project I have analyzed the data of Netflix regarding the Shows and Movies available on the platform using Python libraries such as Numpy and Pandas. 
I have also used Matplotlib and Seaborn in order to create visually appealing charts and graphs. At the End, I made some recommendations based on the Insights from the Data.

I began by cleaning the Data as there were many missing NaN values. After that, I divided data into two parts based on TV Shows and Movies so that I can analyze on a more 
Granular level. I have put in some graphs to showcase the insights.
